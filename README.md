# SO2 laboratory auxiliar infrastructure
The provided repository includes a script for launching a Docker container equipped with a compiled [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux), as utilized in the SO2 laboratories.

# Quick Start
To start the Docker simply run
```
# If you run on Linux
$ sudo ./local.sh docker interactive --privileged
# If you run on WSL
$ sudo ./local.sh docker interactive 
```

If errors occur please see  [How to solve errors](#how-to-solve-errors)

> **Warning**
> The first time you use the previous command it will take a while because the script will pull the image from the [registry](https://gitlab.cs.pub.ro/so2/so2-assignments/container_registry).
> The `--privileged` argument allows the use of KVM if you're runing Linux natively.

Upon successful execution of the command, you will be presented with a Docker shell prompt:

Note that the `/linux` directory within the Docker environment is mounted to a Docker volume, ensuring that any modifications made within the `/linux` directory persist (even if you stop the container).
Also, it's important to note that the working directory within the Docker environment is `/linux/tools/labs`.
This directory is where we will compile modules and start the Virtual Machine.
You will need at least two terminals inside the Docker.
One for compiling, and one for the Virtual Machine console.
For this we recommend `tmux` (Go to section [TMUX cheatsheet](#tmux-cheatsheet)).
Simply type the following command:
```
$ tmux
```

You should see a similar output:

![docker_tmux](./img/docker_tmux.png)

To generate the skeleton for the current laboratory, simply execute the following command, replacing `<lab_name>` with the corresponding laboratory name:
```
$ LABS=<lab name> make skels
```

Next, to start the SO2 VM simply run:
```
make console
```
You might need to wait a few seconds.
Use the `root` username for logging in.

If everything went well you should see something similar:

![docker_tmux_VM](./img/docker_tmux_VM.png)

In the upper pane, we're operating within the VM, while in the lower pane, we're inside Docker.
The `skels` directory is shared between the Docker container and the VM.
Our workflow involves building modules within Docker and then inserting them to the virtual machine via `insmod` or removing them via `rmmod`.
To initiate the module building process run the following command inside the Docker:
```
$ make build
```

> **Warning**
> You DO NOT need to reboot the VM each time you build modules.
> But if you want to stop the Virtual Machine use the following key combination `Ctrl + A then q`.

# Starting the VM (inside the docker) with qemu display
Start the Docker using the following command
```
$ sudo ./local.sh docker interactive --allow-gui
```

> **Warning**
> If you're running on WSL you should follow the steps listed below, before starting the VM!

Start the VM with the following command (inside the docker)
```
make gui
```

Only on WSL, we need to instsall an X11 server:
Just download it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and launch the installer.
After installing it, run the XLaunch app and make sure you select the following checkbox

![XLaunch](./img/XLaunch.png)

"Also, ensure that both of the VcXsrv checkboxes are checked in the Windows Firewall Manager."
![XLaunch2](./img/XLaunch2.png)

Now, you should be able to run the `make gui` command.

> **Warning**
> Just as in the case of `make console`, you DO NOT need to reboot the VM each time you build modules.
> But if you want to stop the Virtual Machine, use the following key combination `Ctrl + A then q` (in the console, not in the qemu display).
> To escape the mouse from the qemu display use `Ctrl + Alt + g`

# Searching Symbols Using VIM + CSCOPE
The kernel compiled within the Docker image also features a cscope database, which you can utilize with vim for symbol searching.
TODO: add commands

# Using VSCode
Even though we love `vim`, it's not the only editor out there.
If you want something fancier, you can use VSCode.
To accomplish this there are two ways, you'll need to access the directory where the `/linux` tree is mounted.

## Option 1 (Suitable for WSL and Linux)
Install the `Dev Containers` and `WSL` extensions in VScode, attach to the container, and open the `/linux` directory.

## Option 2 (Suitable for Linux)
Open the mountpoint of the volume from the host.
This information is displayed at the beginning when you execute the `local.sh` script.

![VScode](./img/VScode.png)

You will probably need to start VScode as the `root` user:
```
sudo code --no-sandbox --user-data-dir /root
```

And from this point you only need to open the directory listed above at the "Mountpoint" field.
In our case is `/var/lib/docker/volumes/SO2_DOCKER_VOLUME/_data`

* SWitch to pane: `Ctrl + b then Arrow Keys`
* Deleting pane: `Ctrl + d`
* Zoom in pane: `Ctrl + b then z`
* Zoom out pane: `Ctrl + b then z`

# How to solve errors

* If `./local.sh docker interactive` seems to block, consider killing it (CTRL + c) and rerun it
* If the `/linux/tools/labs` directory is empty consider removing the volume and rerun the script:
```
$ docker volume rm SO2_DOCKER_VOLUME
$ ./local.sh docker interactive
```
* If you encounter the "bad interpreter" error while attempting to run a script on WSL try [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14219092/bash-script-bin-bashm-bad-interpreter-no-such-file-or-directory)
* If you encounter any other unexpected issues, consider restarting the container.
